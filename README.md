Example spring boot project using spring-ai, function calling with kotlin.

First provide your spring.ai.openai.api-key in application.properties. 
Then start the app and go to http://localhost:8080/?wantedTheme=motorcycle (motorcycle, boat or car)

It register 4 functions (get theme for joke, get boat captain, get the car driver or the motorcycle driver)
Then ask the llm to tell a joke.
LLM resolves that we need to call the functions
And based on the results of the functions construct the joke.

Here's output from running the code with each wanted theme:

```
o.springframework.stereotype.Controller  : Sending prompt: Tell me a joke based on car.
c.b.ai_rag_functions.JokeThemeResolver   : Joke theme resolver called with wanted theme car
c.b.ai_rag_functions.CarDriverResolver   : Car driver resolver called
o.springframework.stereotype.Controller  : Received response:
